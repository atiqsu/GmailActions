This is a sample app for sending emails with embedded structured data in gmail.

There are two ways you can use this app:

- Use the deployed app at gmail-actions.appspot.com.
    - You need to be logged into your gmail account
    - You can test Gamil actions and Google Now cards sending emails to the same account

- Clone the app and use it as a seed to implment your own Gmail Actions handlers.
